These are tasks to be completed to reach the initial version 1.0.0 of the package.

1. Implement differentiation logic between subscribing topic and publishing topic.
2. Tests (?)
3. Contribution guidelines.
4. Might've to add a tool to get interface details. Low priority for now.

    This causes error with creating the messages to be published. A rosbridge solution could work out in this case but is not desirable.
